Test Example
=======

the easiest way to run the code is installing intellij https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ and opening this project with the ide (make sure to set up your project SDK and point it to whatever your version of intellij has or a jdk 1.8)

alternatively, you can run ./gradlew or ./gradlew.bat from a shell but you'll have to install a java jdk first, which can be installed from https://adoptopenjdk.net/
